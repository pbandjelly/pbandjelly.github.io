									I graduate from the Naval Academy in 4 days. It's currently Commissioning Week, a week dedicated
								  to honoring the graduating class. My family comes in on Wednesday to take part in some of
									the festivities. Lots of milestones are materializing. Graduation, commissioning,
									moving into my own apartment... I should be more excited than I currently am. But I'm not. <br><br>
									Maybe I'm burned out. That's possible, given that I have been in school for a long time.
									Or maybe my introverted voice is telling me to get away from people. That's also
									possible, given that an uncomfortable level of human interaction was necessary to maintain any sense of
								  respect at school. Definitely had to step outside the comfort zone with that one.
									The exact reason is probably a combination of multiple factors... not only am I not excited, I also
									feel bored. And despondent. It's almost as if I am dragging my feet in this dirt road of life.
									I need something to happen. <br><br>
									The temporary solace I turn to when feeling extra blue is research. Yeah, I'm a nerd. Reading about
									new deep learning methods for neural networks. The "AI" industry is getting pretty saturated with the
									same neural network parameters being used for the same classification that nothing novel is
									getting done. Reading about top-end research on sites like arXiv gives me the psychedelic jump I
									need to get through one more day. <br><br>
									I didn't expect my first blog post to be so demoralizing. Hopefully the sentiment trend is upwards
									from here.
