									In the first book of Herodotus there's a passage describing the visit of Solon,
									the wise lawgiver of Athens, to Croesus, the wealthy king of Lydia. Croesus asks
									Solon "Who is the happiest man you have ever seen?" expecting Solon to say
									that he, Croesus, is the happiest man. He had everything going for him - lots
									of riches, king of a prospering land, and law abiding citizens. Solon says
									"An Athenian named Tellus." Croesus demands to know what's so great about this
									man Tellus and so Solon goes on to describe key points in Tellus's life. He
									lived in a prosperous city, had fine sons, lived to see each of them have children,
									lived comfortably (in terms of wealth), and he had a glorious death. He died
									falling in battle. The Athenians paid him the highest honor of a public funeral on
									the spot he fell. <br><br>
									It's interesting to see that Solon believed what happens to you after you die -
									specifically what kind of funeral they have and how their name is remembered -
									makes a difference in how good their lives were. Solon probably wasn't drawing
									from a belief in the afterlife, but this raises an interesting question. <b>Does
									skepticism about life after death force one to conclude that what happens after
									you die can't make a difference to how well your life has gone?</b> <br><br>
									There seem to be two possible positions. 1. something can only matter to you if
									it has an impact on your awareness, and 2. what matters is that your preferences
									are satisfied, whether or not you know of it. To extend the thought experiment,
									how far back can one go with position 1 before realizing that the position can
									snowball into a meaningless life? <br><br>
									I don't think ones position on an afterlife should affect their ability to
									give this question an affirmative answer.
